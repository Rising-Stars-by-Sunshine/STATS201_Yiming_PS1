## Description
This dataset mainly queried from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy), which is an open data source sorted by Ansh Tanwar. It showcases sustainable energy indicators and other useful factors across countries from 2000 to 2020. We can dive into vital aspects such as renewable energy, energy intensity, financial flows, and economic growth; and gain profound insights into global energy consumption patterns by comparisons. 

Considering the completeness and real-time nature of the data, I downloaded new data for 2021-2022 from the World Bank (https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0037712/World-Development-Indicators).

I also wrote a code to scrape data for the EIA website, including gas consumption and prices in California, USA, because the data was downloaded directly from the website. You'll see it in the code.
